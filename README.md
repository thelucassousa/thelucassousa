### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lucas, I'm a programmer passionate about technology, self-taught and with a growth mindset. In 2019 I started with front-end and I'm currently developing in C# with the idea of â€‹â€‹reaching the full level. I'm ambitious enough to break out of my comfort zone and flexible enough to adapt to new technologies.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development and enjoy being involved in various stages of the software development lifecycle. My skills allow me to work from the specification to the implementation of the software.
